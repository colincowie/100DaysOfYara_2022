# Day X: Yara Rule for Malware Family Z

In this post, I will describe the Yara rule that I created for malware family Z as part of the #100DaysOfYara challenge.
 
Provide some background information on malware family Z, including its characteristics and any relevant history or context.

# Yara Rule

Here is the Yara rule that I created for malware family Z:

```
rule malware_family_Z {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "A brief description of the rule and what it does."
    reference = "A reference or source for the rule, if applicable."
  strings:
    $string1 = "A string or pattern of bytes to search for in the file."
    $string2 = "Another string or pattern of bytes to search for."
    $regex1 = /a regular expression to search for in the file/
    $regex2 = /another regular expression to search for/
  condition:
    all of them
}
```

# Results

Present the Yara rule that you created and describe its performance. This might include information such as:

- The percentage of known malware samples that the rule correctly identified
- Any false positives or false negatives that the rule produced
- Any notable characteristics or features that the rule is able to detect

# Conclusion

Summarize your findings and discuss any future work that might be necessary to improve the rule or that you plan to do as part of the #100DaysOfYara challenge.
