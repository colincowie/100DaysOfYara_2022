# Day 18 - OneNote Archive Detection
Earlier today Qakbot kicked off a new campaign that leveraged OneNote documents. In somecases this was delivered in the form of an archive with a compressed onenote file within. I was really happy to see that my yara rule from Day 4 was picking up these new Qakbot onenote samples!

Todays yara rule detects small zip archives that contain a onenote sample! 

Some of the example files that I used to guide this rule were:
- 279607.one.zip
    - 2164311b3b574d5c2db95d568408ef02e4afbf67cc2634cc06a4f3a91d1273be
- 830913.one.zip
    - 31c3a8b7505c6dfe7784de00534a0b80be81891d4cbe4577b73a3d4456a49ce9
- 866338.one.zip
    - a78aaef9bc6036d09c196c52e257733b8ec3204d2386389b7add9c35da6d0eb6

To avoid detecting just any archive with a onenote file we will use yara wildcard (`??`) to capture the filename! 

# Yara Rule

Here is the Yara rule that I created for detecting Qakbot archives with OneNote samples
```
rule sus_zip_onenote {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Detects qakbot archives with onenote"
    refrence = "https://twitter.com/Max_Mal_/status/1620423779737567236?s=20"
  strings:
    $onenote_file = { ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 2e 6f 6e 65 55 54} // Checks for six characters followed by .oneUT 
  condition:
	uint32(0) == 0x04034b50 
    and filesize<160KB
    and $onenote_file
}

```
# Results
At first I ran into some issues when just checking for `.one`. Changing this to `.oneUT` fixed the problems! the `UT` is from compressing the file. After implementing this extra check the rule sucessfully picked up just the qakbot campaign!
