# Day 12: Hunting for zip archives containing a compressed exe and language pack

Recently while reviewing information stealer malware distributed by malvertizing I noticied that there were multiple instances of zip archives with languge pack strings from [bandizip](https://en.bandisoft.com/), a archive compression tool.

# Yara Rule

Here is the Yara rule that I created for detecting zip archives containing a executable file and the bandizip strings refrences:

```
rule zip_with_exe_langpack {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Detects zip archives with a compressed exe and a language pack"
  strings:
    $exe = ".exe"
    $langs = "langs/"
    $ini = ".ini"
   condition:
    uint32(0) == 0x04034b50 
    and all of them
    and #ini > 6
}
```

# Results
This rule did return quite a few non-suspicous files. It did also however find a variety of different InfoStealers including:
