# Day 13: Hunting for IcedID archives with wildcards

For todays yara rule I wanted to learn more about using hex patterns for wildcard matching. The offical documentation on using wildcard in yara is here:
- https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.4.0/writingrules.html#hexadecimal-strings

The malware family I'm focused on today is IcedID. One of the IcedID distribution techniques is to use malvertizing to deliver .zip archives containing either a ISO or EXE. IcedID has been using a unique file name schema with this flavor of distribution:

`Setup_Win_24-01-2023_20-15-51.zip` ->  `Setup_Win_24-01-2023_20-15-51.exe` or `.iso`. The filename includes a timestamp of when the download occured: `24-01-2023_20-15-51`. This is the section I want to apply wildcards to as it changess with each download. 

# Yara Rule

Here's the yara rule I wrote for detecting IcedID zip archives! 

```
rule mal_icedid_zip {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Detects zip files used to drop IcedID malware"
    references = "SHA1: a71d76937a6692ee6a464f647b9cb2f611b2dd45"
  strings:
    $filename_hex = { 53 65 74 75 70 5f 57 69 6e 5f ?? ?? 2d ?? ?? 2d ?? ?? ?? ?? 5f ?? ?? 2d ?? ?? 2d ?? ?? 2e ?? ?? ??}
    // Looks for "Setup_Win_??-??-??_??-??-??.???", ie: "Setup_Win_24-01-2023_20-15-51.exe"    
    $exe = ".exe"
    $iso = ".iso"
    $msi = ".msi"
   condition:
    uint32(0) == 0x04034b50 
    and $filename_hex
    and ($exe or $iso or $msi)
}
```

# Results
At first I tried simply ending the hex matching on the `. ` in the filename - `2e }` (does not include the file extension). This caused the yara rule to fail on matching all togther so I changed the ending to  `2e ?? ?? ??}` to allow for matching any file extension. It would be more effective to add in a hex matching alternative for the file name extension but for now the strings should do!  

Once I got that fixed I started getting a steady stream of IcedID archives from VirusTotal retro hunting!
