
# Day 2 | Detecting ExMatter with PE module help 

# Background

Todays yara rule is focused on detecting ExMatter malware (ExMatter is used for data collection prior to Blackcat Ransomware deployment). I used the yara [PE module](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/pe.html) to narrow down results / increase the accuracy of my detection rule. 

Specifically I used `pe.is_pe` and `pe.imports` along with `filesize` filters.

# Yara Rule

Here is the Yara rule that I created for ExMatter:

```
import "pe"
rule mal_exmatter {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Detects ExMatter files"
    reference = "https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/noberus-blackcat-ransomware-ttps"
  strings:
    $string1 = "sync_enc"
    $string2 = "CreateSocks"
    $string3 = "sync.exe"
  condition:
    pe.is_pe 
    and pe.imports("mscoree.dll")
    and (filesize>800KB and filesize<10MB)
    and 2 of them
}
```

# Results
At first I mistakenly used `pe.imports` incorrectly, after fixing that to detect on the import file name (`mscoree.dll`) and not the underlying function (`_CorExeMain`) I managed to get nice results!
