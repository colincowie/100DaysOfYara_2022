# Day 15: Hunting for "cracked" Software InfoStealers

Today I wanted to write a generic rule for suspicious archives with "cracked" software. Multiple threat groups package malware such as InfoStealers into "cracked" archives (frequently `.zip` or `.rar`). This great blog helped me learn more about rar detection:

The samples I reviewed to help guide todays rule was:
- `Setup2023.zip` / [b5b547d7587e10ea5d0bb099e65f4fbed556f4cf](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/09b2f41cccae7d13eef3789fda24f86b718e044928af37dd4d8cb4e667343675/details)
- `RepackedSoft_1.26.rar` / [0992aefe65e2471cba2936a0dd266ed30b3ca067](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/79a76e42c77f58d94f8238fa4a40c9f710a64f20bb33e11f4f8ca2b21c7eacc2)
- `Microsoft Office Cracked.zip`/ [0db424b09eeb15d4de69bba1f8ec9b66f96bfe65](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/29684f349d7f8a73d2649465785158916d365a4468228dd3af583ea09daccec4/details)

# Yara Rule

Here is the Yara rule that I created for detecting suspicious archives with "cracked" software

```
rule sus_cracks_archive {
    meta:
  	    author = "Colin Cowie"
        description = "Detects archives used for cracked software"
        references = "https://blog.xorhex.com/blog/onehundreddiscontiguousdaysofyara-day6/"
  strings:
        $rar_header = { 52 61 72 21 1A 07 00 }
        $cracker = "Cracker.dll" nocase
        $setup = "setup" nocase
    condition:
        (uint32(0) == 0x04034b50 or $rar_header at 0 ) // check for zip or rar
        and $cracker
        and $setup
}
```

# Results
At first I attempted to write a rule that would detect only RedLine stealer related cracked software but had some issues and settled for this generic rule! This more generic rule had some nice results including a large amount of "cracks" and "hacks" there were uploaded to transfer[.]sh.
