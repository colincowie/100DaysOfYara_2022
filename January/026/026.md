# Day 26 | Using the VirusTotal module to detect CobaltStrike behavior 

If you have access to VirusTotal Intelligence you can make use of the `vt` module for retrohunting and livehunting. For todays rule I wanted to learn more about the `vt` module and how it can be used to detect on file behavior.

In a IcedID infection reported by researchers earlier today a CobaltStrike DLL that used was observed:
- https://github.com/pan-unit42/tweets/blob/master/2023-02-08-IOCs-for-Cobalt-Strike-from-IcedID.txt

Todays rule uses the VT module to detect DLLs that use the jquery cobaltstrike C2 profile

# Yara Rule
Here's the yara rule I wrote: 
```
import "vt"
rule dll_cobaltstrike_profile {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Detects DLLs performing a request to a known cobaltstrike mallable C2 profile"
    reference  = "https://github.com/pan-unit42/tweets/blob/master/2023-02-08-IOCs-for-Cobalt-Strike-from-IcedID.txt"
  condition:
    vt.metadata.file_type == vt.FileType.PE_DLL
  	and (
    		for any entry in vt.behaviour.http_conversations : (entry.url contains "/jquery" and entry.url contains ".min.js")
        )
    and filesize<1MB
}
```
# Results
Retrohunting with this rule had a somewhat small amount of matched files. Ideally this rule would be expanded to have other common CobaltStrike C2 profiles.

One of the matched files was:
- logs.dll / [e8c806acdb51047c30ceabd419c176e3c085bb3fe009ed3e681f82ff72d05ea9](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e8c806acdb51047c30ceabd419c176e3c085bb3fe009ed3e681f82ff72d05ea9)
  - C2: `https[:]//datamsupd[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js`
