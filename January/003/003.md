# Day 3: Detecting Microsoft OneNote Files

Todays yara rule is for detecting Microsoft OneNote files.

# Background

In december of 2022 TrustWave reported that [Trojanized OneNote Documents Lead to Formbook Malware](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/trojanized-onenote-document-leads-to-formbook-malware/?&web_view=true) . Today I wrote a small but nimble rule to identify OneNote files.


# Yara Rule

Here is the Yara rule that I created for OneNote:

```
rule file_format_onenote {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Detects onenote"
  strings:
  	$file_header = { E4 52 5C 7B 8C D8 A7 4D AE B1 53 78 D0 29 96 D3 }
  condition:
	$file_header at 0
}
```
