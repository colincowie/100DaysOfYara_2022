# Day 1 - Shaking off the Rust | Detecting archives with VBS Scripts 

To kick off 100DaysOfYara I wanted to start with writing a rule to detect Archives containing a VBS file. Many different Malware families such as Danabot leverage .zip files to deliver VBS scripts.    

# Methodology
The logic for detecting zip headers are covered in [this great blog post](https://kevinwinata.com/blog/zip-header-yara/). I added a LNK string and size limit on the results found.

# Yara Rule

Here is the Yara rule that I created to detect suspicious zip files
```
rule sus_zip_vbs {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Detects .zip file containing a VBS"
    reference = "https://kevinwinata.com/blog/zip-header-yara/"
  strings:
    $zip_header = {50 4B 03 04}
    $vbs_file = ".vbs"
    $lnk_string = "LNK"
  condition:
    filesize<10MB and
    $lnk_string and
    for any i in (1..#zip_header):
      ($vbs_file in (@zip_header[i]+30..@zip_header[i]+30+uint16(@zip_header[i]+26)))
}
```

# Results

This Yara rule had somewhat underwhelming results. There is a handful of clean files on VirusTotal this fired on. There was however a few interesting results such as this archive: [9657b8105c7e1729b77335234f201b58dc61183a](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/33e0c6706f2a8fddd4c443f23f6f6e206670cc8759d818f78f6af9acaeeaf129/details)

This archive contains a obsfucated VBS script that was uploaded to VirusTotal in October:
