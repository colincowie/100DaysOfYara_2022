# Day 14 - Improving my IcedID rule with Hex Jumps
Todays yara rule is a continuation of yesterdays! Yesterday I wrote a rule to detect IcedID archives with the file name "Setup_Win_[timestamp].zip". Today let's take a look at IcedID campaigns using IRS w9 forms as the theme. There is some data on these IRS themed payloads here:

Examples of variance:
- `IRS_form_package_19-01-2023_17-09-50.zip`
  -  de037d8e3ba43d7a3474b69102dc4aae51ecc2759bb0b2d6b7111c93cea54e28
- `IRS_form_Package_17-01-2023_19-25-53 (1).zip`
  - 0e4475e34d30c7354eb9b05c040a71625d239e7749b7339d17d314724178da40
- `IRS_Form_12-01-9.zip`
  - 738cc370a87bc239568ff5f047abea91bdef59d20df8f518dba7fe4e845cd3f5
  
Todays rule uses Yara Jumps to check for the following filename strings:
- `IRS_(f|F)orm_[3-24 bytes][any character]`

I've so added in support for .lnk & cmd abuse to match some of the older samples such as the 3rd one listed above. 

I'm also using the Jumps to match files ending in both just `IRS_Form_12-01-9.zip` or `IRS_Form_12-01-9 (1).zip`

# Yara Rule
This is what my updated yara rule looks like!
```
rule mal_icedid_archives{
  meta:
  	author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Detects zip files used to drop IcedID malware"
    references = "https://infosec.exchange/@bencrypted/109746344873648863"
  strings:
    $setup_filename =  { 53 65 74 75 70 5f 57 69 6e 5f ?? ?? 2d ?? ?? 2d ?? ?? ?? ?? 5f ?? ?? 2d ?? ?? 2d ?? ?? 2e [0-6] ?? ?? ??} 
    $IRS_filename = {49 52 53 5f (66|46) 6f 72 6d 5f [4-34] ??}
    $exe = ".exe"
    $iso = ".iso"
    $msi = ".msi"
    $cmd = ".cmd"
    $lnk = ".lnk"
   condition:
    uint32(0) == 0x04034b50 
    and ($setup_filename or $IRS_filename)
	and ($exe or $iso or $msi or $cmd or $lnk)
}

```

# Results
The main challenge of todays rule writing was figuring out how to get the hex matching patterns working! After a while of messing around with CyberChefs "To & From Hex" operations I was able craft the needed Hex Jumps to add support for
- Files renamed due to duplicates on disk
- Changing letter capitalization 
- Wildcard matching for portions of the filename that aren't always present

Overall hex jumps and wildcards are really useful for improving a rules quality!
