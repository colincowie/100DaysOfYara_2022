# Day 28 - Using the VT yara module for detection coverage monitoring

Todays yara rule is designed for VirusTotal livehunting. It uses the yara vt module to checks if:
- The file was just uploaded (no noise from rescans)
- If anyone is detecting the file as qakbot or qbot
- If Sophos reports the file as Undetected

# Yara Rule
Here's the yara rule I wrote!

```
import "vt"
rule qakbot_detection_gap {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Finds Qakbot samples missing Sophos detection coverage"
  condition:
    // ensure the file is a new file upload on VT and not a rescan
    vt.metadata.new_file 
    // First check if anyone is detecting the file as qakbot 
    and for any engine, signature in vt.metadata.signatures : (
      signature contains "qakbot" or signature contains "QAKBOT" or signature contains "QakBot" or signature contains "QBot"  or signature contains "Qbot"
    )
    // Then check if Sophos isn't detecting it:
    and for any engine, signature in vt.metadata.signatures : (
      engine == "Sophos" and signature == ""
    )
}

```
# Results
While creating this rule it took me a couple attempts to determine that `signature == ""` is how you match on `Undetected` files. Using the VirusTotal goodware dataset helped with testing!
