# Day 6: Suspicious LNK files

For todays yara rule I wanted to write a detection for suspicious .LNK files that leverage the Windows CMD file format (`.cmd`). 

I used a lnk file [observed](https://infosec.exchange/@th3_protoCOL/109707069602928273) with IcedID malware earlier today. 

Belkasoft's blog post [Forensic Analysis of LNK Files](https://belkasoft.com/forensic-analysis-of-lnk-files) was used to learn about .LNK file headers
 
# Yara Rule

Here's the Yara rule I created for detecting suspicious .LNK files:

```
rule sus_lnk_files {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Yara rule to detect suspicious .LNK files used by IcedID and other malware families"
    reference = "SHA1: 92ba4c948890d67927afa26727474e563e6d1bdf"
  strings:
    $lnk_header = { 4C 00 00 00 }
    $shell = "shell32.dll" ascii wide
    $cmd = "cmd.exe" ascii wide
    $cmd_file = ".cmd" ascii wide
  condition:  
    all of them
    and $lnk_header at 0
    and filesize<5KB
}

```

# Results
Retrohunting on VirusTotal with this rule returned some really positive results! It seemed like most of the results were either Qakbot or IcedID such as:
