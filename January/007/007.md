# Day 7 - Detecting Batloader JavaScript

In recent months batloader changed it's delivery methods and leveraged Javascript files during inital infection. TrendMicro discussed the evolution of batloader in their recent article: [Batloader Malware Abuses Legitimate Tools, Uses Obfuscated JavaScript Files in Q4 2022 Attacks](trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/a/batloader-malware-abuses-legitimate-tools-uses-obfuscated-javasc.html).

Todays yara rule is aiming to detect batloader javascript files. To achive this goal i'm using the yara filesize and the (new to me) [count](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.4.0/writingrules.html#counting-strings) conditional.

The three samples mentioned by TrendMicro that I reviewed and used to write this rule are:
- `InstallerV61.js`
  - [aef18b7ab1710aaeb0d060127750ba9d17413035309ec74213d538fb1b1bdf79](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/aef18b7ab1710aaeb0d060127750ba9d17413035309ec74213d538fb1b1bdf79/details)
- `InstallerV201.js`
  - [91730741d72584f96ccba99ac9387e09b17be6d64728673871858ea917543c1e](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/91730741d72584f96ccba99ac9387e09b17be6d64728673871858ea917543c1e/details)
- `InstallerV30.3.js`	
  - [61e0926120f49b3d5edf3a5e0842b04640911974ecbbc93b6b33ca20c1f981bc](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/61e0926120f49b3d5edf3a5e0842b04640911974ecbbc93b6b33ca20c1f981bc/details)

# Yara Rule

Here's the Yara rule that I created for detecting batloader javascript malware:

```
rule sus_js_batloader {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Detects javascript files similar to batloader"
    reference = "https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/a/batloader-malware-abuses-legitimate-tools-uses-obfuscated-javasc.html"
  strings:
    $wscript = "ActiveXObject(\"WScript.Shell\")" nocase
    $cmd = "cmd /c " nocase
    $bat = ".bat" nocase
    $sleep = "WScript.Sleep(" nocase
  condition:
    all of them
    and #cmd > 3
    and #bat > 2
    and #sleep > 2
    and filesize < 5KB
}
```

# Conclusion
Todays rule seems to achieve high fidelity detection for batloader javascript malware. We'll have to wait and see if more batloader campaigns leverage javascript in the future to fully evaluate this rule!
