# Day 27 | More practice with the VT module - JS Malware

For todays rule I wanted to practice more with using the VirusTotal yara module.

Recently proofpoint shared recent about a new threat actor they track as TA866:
- [Screentime: Sometimes It Feels Like Somebody's Watching Me](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/screentime-sometimes-it-feels-like-somebodys-watching-me)

Todays rule uses the VT module to detect javascript files that download a `msi` file.

# Yara Rule
Here's the yara rule I wrote for detecting javascript downloading a .msi file!

```
import "vt"
rule sus_js_msi_download {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Detects JavaScript files downloading a MSI"
    reference  = "2cd65ad25be03b25c6deb73ddc4697ff39953742"
  condition:	
    vt.metadata.file_type == vt.FileType.JAVASCRIPT	// Check for .js file type
    and for any c in vt.behaviour.http_conversations : (
      c.request_method == vt.Http.Method.GET // Check sandbox network data for a GET request
      and 
      c.url endswith ".msi" //Check for .msi in URL
    )
    and filesize<500KB
}
```
# Results

Retrohunting with this rule found a few C2 servers not mentioned in the proofpoint write up including:
