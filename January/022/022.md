# Day 22 - Hunting for OneNote Abuse | Matching on `wide` strings

Windows systems often use UTF-16 encoding (aka Wide text) for some aspects of an Office document. 

For an example - in recent OneNote malware campaigns the following string shows up as wide text:

- Human Readable: 
    - `double click "open"`

- UTF-16: 
    - `d.o.u.b.l.e. .c.l.i.c.k. .".o.p.e.n.".`

For todays yara rule I spent some time learning about UTF-8 vs UTF-16 and when to use wide strings! TLDR; Use the `wide` modifier if you know for sure your string is UTF-16, otherwise just use the default!

# Yara Rule
Here's the yara rule I wrote that appropriately uses `wide`

```
rule sus_onenote_button {
  meta:
    author = "Colin Cowie"
    description = "Detects OneNote files with a click to open message"
  strings:
  	$file_header = { E4 52 5C 7B 8C D8 A7 4D AE B1 53 78 D0 29 96 D3 }
  	$prompt = "double click \"open\"" wide nocase
  condition:
  	$file_header at 0
    and $prompt
    and filesize<750KB
}
```
# Results
Retrohunting with this rule found just over 2,000 recent OneNote malware samples! Both Qakbot and IcedID.
