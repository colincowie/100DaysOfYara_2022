# Day 21 - Using the `vt` Yara Module

For todays rule I wanted to learn more about the vt yara module. This module lets you acess metadata like antivirus signatures, file type, file behavior, submitter.

I've taken my generic `.appx` detection rule and have used the `vt` module to check for suspicious files using the vt conditionals to check for:
- files with more than 5 detections
OR
- files with more than 1 detection that were uploaded from China or Russia

# Yara Rule

Here is the Yara rule that uses of the `vt` module to detect possible appx malware!

```
import "vt"
rule sus_appx_files {
	meta:
        author = "Colin Cowie"
        description = "Detects suspicious appx files with the help of the VirusTotal module"
        reference = "https://twitter.com/f0wlsec/status/1481338661824307204"
    strings:
        $header = { 50 4B 03 04 }
        $xml_string = "AppxManifest.xmlPK"
        $ct_xml = "[Content_Types].xmlPK"
        $ci_cat = "AppxMetadata/CodeIntegrity.catPK"
        $signature_string = "AppxSignature.p7xPK"
        $block_map = "AppxBlockMap.xmlPK"
    condition:
        $header at 0 
        and $xml_string and $ct_xml and $ci_cat and $signature_string and $block_map
        and (vt.metadata.analysis_stats.malicious > 5 or (vt.metadata.analysis_stats.malicious > 1 and (vt.metadata.submitter.country == "CN" or vt.metadata.submitter.country == "RU")))
}
```
# Results
Added in these `vt` conditionals significantly trimmed down the number of results.
