# 100DaysOfYara_2022
#100DaysOfYara is a challenge in which participants aim to create 100 Yara rules over the course of 100 days. This could involve creating new rules to identify previously unknown malware, or updating and improving existing rules.

I will be starting the 100DaysOfYara challenge on Monday Janurary 9th!
